### Bike Animation Project

Welcome to the Bike Animation Project! This interactive JavaScript project enables users to control the movement of a bike in various ways, including forward, reverse, stop, restart, faster, or slower.

#### Project Overview

The project offers a simple yet engaging interface with buttons that allow users to trigger different functionalities. Users can interact with the buttons to make the bike move forward, reverse its direction, stop the animation, restart it from the beginning, or adjust the speed (either faster or slower).

#### Key Features

- **Forward Movement**: Click the "FORWARD" button to make the bike move forward.
- **Reverse Movement**: Click the "REVERSE" button to make the bike move in reverse.
- **Stop Animation**: Use the "STOP" button to halt the animation at any time.
- **Restart Animation**: Press the "RESTART" button to reset the animation to its initial state.
- **Speed Control**: Adjust the speed of the animation using the "INCREASE SPEED" or "DECREASE SPEED" buttons.

#### Known Issues

While the project offers basic functionality, there are still some glitches related to the efficiency of the `clearInterval` function, especially when transitioning between different animation states. Work is ongoing to address these issues and enhance the overall user experience.

#### Getting Started

To get started with the project, simply clone the repository to your local machine and open the `movingbike.html` file in your web browser. Experiment with the different buttons to explore the various animation functionalities.
