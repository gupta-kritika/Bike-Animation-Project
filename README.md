Hi everyone!
I have created this simple yet interactive Javascript Project that enable the user to make a bike move forward, in reverse, stop, restart, faster or slower. 
The project contains buttons for achieving these functionalities. 
The project still needs improvement as some of the functionalities might not work one after the other.
This is caused by the ineffeciency of the clearInterval function that is not handling the order of the interval clearings required in some cases.
I would be happy to receive some help and make improvements in the project regarding the existing glitches and otherwise.
Hope you find this interesting :)
